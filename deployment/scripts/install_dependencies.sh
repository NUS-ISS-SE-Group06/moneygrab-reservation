# Example: Update package lists and install Java if not already done via userdata or AMI
# Ensure Java 21 is installed. Assuming a system where 'java' might not be pre-installed or is an older version.
# For Amazon Linux:
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y java-21-amazon-corretto-devel
sudo yum install -y mariadb1011-client-utils

# Example: Install other necessary packages (e.g., unzip, git, etc.)
sudo yum install -y unzip # For Amazon Linux

# Create necessary directories if they don't exist
# Note: These are directories *outside* the app's final destination, or temporary ones.
# The app's /home/ec2-user/app directory is handled by CodeDeploy's file deployment.
# mkdir -p /var/log/my-java-app # Example for external logs if needed

echo "BeforeInstall Hook completed."
